# Advent of Code 2022

## Overview

My solutions to [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) written in Python 3.10. My objective this year: to make it past day 10 before I get too distracted by real-life Christmas chaos.

Using Python isn't particularly imaginative for me, this is the same language I've used in previous years. However I don't do much coding and Python is the language I'm most likely to use, so it makes sense to keep my hand in somehow.

## New this year

I've been using the [Advent of Code data (aocd)](https://github.com/wimglenn/advent-of-code-data) module for years - I think it's brilliant. However this year I've gone a little further and created a class with some utility functions to help me test my solutions against the example input and answer provided in the puzzle descriptions, and then to submit my solutions using aocd. For more information have a look in `dave_utils.py`.

## Thing I Learned

There are some additional notes on things I learned in [TIL.md](TIL.md).
